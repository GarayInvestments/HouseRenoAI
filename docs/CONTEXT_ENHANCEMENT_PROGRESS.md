# AI Context Enhancement - Progress Document

**Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Objective:** Expand AI context fields to improve response quality without excessive token costs  
**Strategy:** Hybrid Tier 1 + Tier 2 approach (enhanced context + on-demand detail)

### Projects Sheet (17 columns total)
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS ENHANCEMENT** - Only 7 of 17 fields shown

| Field | Currently Shown | Priority | Action |
|-------|----------------|----------|--------|
| Project ID | ✅ Yes | Critical | ✓ Keep |
| Client ID | ✅ Yes | Critical | ✓ Keep |
| Project Name | ✅ Yes | Critical | ✓ Keep |
| Project Address | ✅ Yes | Critical | ✓ Keep |
| Status | ✅ Yes | High | ✓ Keep |
| Client Name | ✅ Yes | High | ✓ Keep |
| HR PC Service Fee | ✅ Yes | Critical | ✓ Keep |
| **Project Type** | ❌ No | **High** | **➕ ADD** |
| **Start Date** | ❌ No | **High** | **➕ ADD** |
| **Project Cost** | ❌ No | **High** | **➕ ADD** |
| **County** | ❌ No | **Medium** | **➕ ADD** |
| City | ❌ No | Medium | Skip (redundant with Address) |
| Jurisdiction | ❌ No | Low | Skip (Tier 2) |
| Primary Inspector | ❌ No | Low | Skip (Tier 2) |
| Owner Name | ❌ No | Low | Skip (Tier 2) |
| Scope of Work | ❌ No | Low | Skip (Tier 2) |
| Photo Album | ❌ No | Low | Skip (Tier 2) |
| Notes | ❌ No | Low | Skip (Tier 2) |

**Token Impact:**
- Current: 7 fields × 50 projects = 350 data points
- Enhanced: 11 fields × 50 projects = 550 data points
- Increase: +200 data points (~57% increase, acceptable)

**Justification for Added Fields:**
- **Project Type**: Users ask "Is this residential or commercial?"
- **Start Date**: Timeline queries "When did this project start?"
- **Project Cost**: Budget questions "What's the total project budget?"
- **County**: Jurisdiction/location queries "Which county is this in?"

### Permits Sheet (8 columns total)
**Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS ENHANCEMENT** - Only 5 of 8 fields shown

| Field | Currently Shown | Priority | Action |
|-------|----------------|----------|--------|
| Permit ID | ✅ Yes | Critical | ✓ Keep |
| Permit Number | ✅ Yes | High | ✓ Keep |
| Permit Type | ✅ Yes | High | ✓ Keep |
| Status | ✅ Yes | High | ✓ Keep |
| Address | ✅ Yes | High | ✓ Keep |
| **Project ID** | ❌ No | **Critical** | **➕ ADD** |
| **Application Date** | ❌ No | **High** | **➕ ADD** |
| **Approval Date** | ❌ No | **High** | **➕ ADD** |
| Notes | ❌ No | Low | Skip (Tier 2) |

**Token Impact:**
- Current: 5 fields × permits = ~5 data points per permit
- Enhanced: 8 fields × permits = ~8 data points per permit
- Increase: +60% (acceptable - permits dataset typically smaller)

**Justification for Added Fields:**
- **Project ID**: CRITICAL for linking permits to projects
- **Application Date**: Timeline "When was this permit applied for?"
- **Approval Date**: Timeline "When was it approved?"

## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update Context Display ⏳
**File:** `app/services/openai_service.py`

**Task 1.1:** Enhance Projects Context (lines 398-420)
```python
# Add these field extractions:
project_type = safe_field(project.get('Project Type'))
start_date = safe_field(project.get('Start Date'))
project_cost = safe_field(project.get('Project Cost (Materials + Labor)'))
county = safe_field(project.get('County'))

# Add to context_parts.append():
f"\n  Project Type: {project_type}"
f"\n  Start Date: {start_date}"
f"\n  Project Cost: {project_cost}"
f"\n  County: {county}"
```

**Task 1.2:** Enhance Permits Context (lines 423-438)
```python
# Add these field extractions:
project_id = safe_field(permit.get('Project ID'))
application_date = safe_field(permit.get('Application Date'))
approval_date = safe_field(permit.get('Approval Date'))

# Add to context_parts.append():
f"\n  Project ID: {project_id}"
f"\n  Applied: {application_date}"
f"\n  Approved: {approval_date}"
```

---

### Phase 2: Update AI Instructions ⏳
**File:** `app/services/openai_service.py`

**Task 2.1:** Add to system prompt (around lines 40-100)
```python
"""
When user requests "details", "summary", "more information", or "everything" about 
a client/project/permit, show ALL available fields from the context data, not just 
a subset. Include Project ID, Client ID, dates, costs, and all other fields.
"""
```

---

### Phase 3: Testing ⏳
**Test Queries:**
1. "What's the project cost for Javier Martinez's project?"
   - Expected: Should show Project Cost field
2. "When did the Temple project start?"
   - Expected: Should show Start Date
3. "Is this a residential or commercial project?"
   - Expected: Should show Project Type
4. "When was the permit for 47 Main applied?"
   - Expected: Should show Application Date
5. "Show me all details for Javier's project"
   - Expected: Should show all 11 project fields

---

### Phase 4: Deployment ⏳
1. Commit changes with clear message
2. Push to main (auto-deploys to Render)
3. Monitor Render logs for context size
4. Verify token usage hasn't spiked excessively

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Token Cost Impact
**Current Context Size:**
- Clients: 9 fields × 50 = 450 data points
- Projects: 7 fields × 50 = 350 data points
- Permits: 5 fields × 20 = 100 data points
- **Total: ~900 data points** ≈ 3,600 tokens

**Enhanced Context Size:**
- Clients: 9 fields × 50 = 450 data points (no change)
- Projects: 11 fields × 50 = 550 data points (+200)
- Permits: 8 fields × 20 = 160 data points (+60)
- **Total: ~1,160 data points** ≈ 4,640 tokens

**Cost Increase:** ~29% more context tokens per query
**Benefit:** Eliminates need for follow-up queries about dates, costs, types

### Quality Improvements
✅ Users can ask about project budgets without additional queries  
✅ Timeline questions answered immediately (start dates, application dates)  
✅ Permit-to-project linking visible (Project ID in permits)  
✅ Location queries answered (county information)  
✅ Detailed summaries now truly comprehensive

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Tier 2)

### On-Demand Full Detail Loading
When user explicitly asks for scope, notes, inspector info:
- Add function tool: `get_project_full_details(project_id)`
- Returns ALL 17 fields from Google Sheets API
- Only called when needed, not loaded in every context

**Example Query:** "What's the scope of work for Temple project?"
**AI Action:** 
1. Check context for Project ID
2. Call `get_project_full_details("4717d93f")`
3. Return Scope of Work field specifically

**Benefit:** Zero token cost for rarely-used fields until actually needed

## 📝 Change Log

### November 10, 2025 - Planning Phase
- Analyzed current field display across all sheets
- Identified 4 high-value missing fields in Projects
- Identified 3 critical missing fields in Permits
- Confirmed Clients sheet already optimized (9/11 fields shown)
- Created implementation plan and progress tracking document

---

## ✅ Success Metrics

Track these after deployment:

1. **Average tokens per query:**
   - Before: ~3,600 context tokens
   - After: ~4,640 context tokens
   - Target: <30% increase ✅

2. **Query resolution rate:**
   - Questions answered without follow-up API calls
   - Target: +25% improvement

3. **User satisfaction:**
   - "Show details" requests now comprehensive
   - Project cost/dates immediately available
   - Permit timeline tracking enabled

4. **Performance:**
   - Response time should remain <2 seconds
   - No degradation from additional context

---

**Status:** 📋 Ready for implementation  
**Next Step:** Begin Phase 1 - Update context display code
