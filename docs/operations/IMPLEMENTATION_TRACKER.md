# House Renovators AI - Implementation Tracker

**Version**: 5.0 (Compliance Realignment)  
**Last Updated**: December 15, 2025 12:45 PM EST  
**Current Phase**: **PHASE Q (Qualifier Compliance Foundation) - ✅ COMPLETE**  
**Overall Progress**: Phases 0-Q Complete (100%)

> **Purpose**: Active execution tracker for current and upcoming work. Historical phases (0-E) archived in `docs/archive/IMPLEMENTATION_HISTORY.md` for audit/compliance. See `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` for technical specs.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PRIORITY: Phase Q (Qualifier Compliance)

**STATUS**: 🔴 **MANDATORY - CANNOT BE DEFERRED**

**Why This Takes Priority**:
- Compliance systems are **foundational**, not additive
- Partial implementation is more dangerous than no implementation
- Current system can silently allow illegal states (qualifier capacity exceeded, etc.)
- Legal exposure exists now, not in the future

**Phase Q supersedes all other planned work until complete.**

## 🔴 Phase Q: Qualifier Compliance Foundation (IN PROGRESS - 60%)

**Timeline**: 3-5 days (interleaved with other responsibilities)  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Risk**: Minimal (additive only, but foundational)  
**Status**: **Q.3 API ENDPOINTS COMPLETE ✅ (Dec 14, 12:02 PM EST)**

### Q.1: Database Schema ✅ COMPLETE (Dec 14, 4:30 PM EST yesterday)

**Migration**: `20251214_0100_add_qualifier_compliance_tables.py`

**What Was Built**:

**5 New Tables Created**:
- ✅ `licensed_businesses` - Business entities holding NCLBGC licenses (LB-00001 format)
- ✅ `qualifiers` - Individuals with qualifier status (1:1 with users via user_id FK)
- ✅ `licensed_business_qualifiers` - Time-bounded relationships with capacity enforcement (max 2)
- ✅ `oversight_actions` - Canonical compliance records with immutable audit trail (OA-00001)
- ✅ `compliance_justifications` - Audit log for rule overrides with approval workflow (CJ-00001)

**Existing Tables Enhanced**:
- ✅ `projects` - Added 5 columns (licensed_business_id, qualifier_id, engagement_model, oversight_required, compliance_notes)
- ✅ `permits` - Added 4 columns (licensed_business_id, qualifier_id, license_number_used, responsibility_role)
- ✅ `site_visits` - Added 4 columns (oversight_type, qualifier_id, qualifier_present, oversight_justification)
- ✅ `inspections` - Added 2 columns (qualifier_attended, oversight_site_visit_id)
- ✅ `users` - Added 1 column (is_qualifier as UI convenience flag only)

**Enforcement Mechanisms Active**:
- ✅ **Capacity trigger** - Blocks qualifiers from serving >2 licensed businesses with date overlap
- ✅ **Cutoff trigger** - Blocks oversight actions after qualifier relationship ends (uses action_date for historical correctness)
- ✅ **Unique constraint** - Prevents duplicate active relationships for same business-qualifier pair (uq_lbq_active_pair)
- ✅ **Auto-generated business IDs** - LB-00001, QF-00001, OA-00001, CJ-00001 format
- ✅ **Compliance indexes** - Efficient reporting queries for regulator audits

**Critical Design Decisions**:
- ✅ Qualifier identity: `qualifiers.user_id` FK (1:1 to users), NOT shared UUIDs
- ✅ Business context explicit everywhere: `licensed_business_id` + `qualifier_id` on projects, permits, oversight_actions
- ✅ Oversight hierarchy: `oversight_actions` = canonical record, site_visits/inspections = supporting evidence only
- ✅ Denormalized fields marked: `licensed_businesses.qualifying_user_id` labeled "NEVER use in enforcement"
- ✅ Nullable FKs during Phase Q.1 for safe backfill, will enforce NOT NULL in Phase Q.2
- ✅ Function renamed to avoid collision: `update_updated_at_column_compliance()` (scoped to compliance schema)
- ✅ Race condition acceptance documented: Low concurrency risk, unique constraint provides mitigation

**Validation**:
- ✅ All 5 new tables exist in production database
- ✅ All 14 new columns added to existing tables
- ✅ Both enforcement triggers active (capacity, cutoff)
- ✅ Unique constraint on active LBQ pairs verified
- ✅ Foreign keys reference correct primary keys (project_id, visit_id, not id)
- ✅ Complete downgrade path with function cleanup

**Hours**: 12 hours (includes design reviews, fixes, testing)

**Hours**: 12 hours (includes design reviews, fixes, testing)

### Q.2: Backend Models + Services ✅ COMPLETE (Dec 14, 11:30 AM EST)

**Goal**: Add SQLAlchemy models for new tables and update existing models with qualifier context

**What Was Built**:

**✅ NEW SQLALCHEMY MODELS (5 tables)**:
1. `LicensedBusiness` - NC licensed business entities (LB-00001 format)
   - Includes license_number, license_type, license_status
   - Auto-generated business_id via database trigger
   - Supports denormalized qualifying_user_id (convenience only)

2. `Qualifier` - Individual qualifiers with capacity enforcement (QF-00001)
   - 1:1 relationship with User (via user_id FK)
   - max_licenses_allowed field (default: 2)
   - Auto-generated qualifier_id via database trigger

3. `LicensedBusinessQualifier` - Time-bounded relationships (junction table)
   - Enforces max 2 businesses per qualifier (via DB trigger)
   - start_date, end_date, cutoff_date columns
   - Unique constraint on active pairs (end_date IS NULL)

4. `OversightAction` - Immutable compliance audit trail (OA-00001)
   - action_type: site_visit, plan_review, permit_review, etc.
   - action_date enforced by cutoff_date trigger
   - JSONB fields: attendees, photos
   - Auto-generated action_id via database trigger

5. `ComplianceJustification` - Rule override tracking (CJ-00001)
   - rule_type: capacity_limit, cutoff_date, oversight_minimum
   - Approval workflow: requested_by, approved_by, approval_status
   - Auto-generated justification_id via database trigger

**✅ UPDATED EXISTING MODELS (5 tables)**:
- `Project`: +5 columns (licensed_business_id, qualifier_id, engagement_model, oversight_required, compliance_notes)
- `Permit`: +4 columns (licensed_business_id, qualifier_id, license_number_used, responsibility_role)
- `SiteVisit`: +4 columns (oversight_type, qualifier_id, qualifier_present, oversight_justification)
- `Inspection`: +2 columns (qualifier_attended, oversight_site_visit_id)
- `User`: +1 column (is_qualifier as UI flag only, NOT authoritative)

**✅ NEW DB_SERVICE METHODS (8 total)**:

**CREATE OPERATIONS**:
- `create_licensed_business()` - Create NC licensed business entities
- `create_qualifier()` - Create qualifier (1:1 with user_id FK, validates uniqueness)
- `assign_qualifier_to_business()` - Create LBQ relationship (DB trigger enforces capacity)
- `create_oversight_action()` - Log compliance actions (DB trigger enforces cutoff)
- `create_compliance_justification()` - Track rule overrides with approval workflow

**QUERY OPERATIONS**:
- `get_qualifier_by_user_id()` - Lookup qualifier by user (1:1 relationship)
- `get_active_qualifier_assignments()` - Get current business-qualifier relationships (end_date IS NULL)
- `check_qualifier_capacity()` - Pre-check if qualifier can take another business (max_licenses_allowed validation)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Trigger enforcement: Methods rely on DB triggers for capacity/cutoff validation (no duplicate logic)
- User-friendly errors: Re-raises trigger errors as-is (already formatted for users)
- TTL caching: Query methods cached for 60-120 seconds
- Type safety: Full type hints with Optional[] for nullable fields
- Auto-generated IDs: business_id, qualifier_id, action_id via triggers (FetchedValue in SQLAlchemy)

**Validation**:
- ✅ All 5 new models import successfully
- ✅ All 8 db_service methods import successfully
- ✅ Models follow existing patterns (UUID PKs, server_default for triggers, JSONB for arrays)
- ✅ Services follow db_service conventions (async, error handling, caching, logging)
- ✅ Ready for route integration in Phase Q.3

**Hours**: 12 hours (models: 6h, services: 6h)

---

- Inspections (new page)
- Invoices & Payments (new pages)
- Site Visits (new page)

### F.1: Fix Permits Page Display (✅ COMPLETE - 2/2 hours)

**Goal**: Update existing Permits.jsx to display data from PostgreSQL database

**Status**: ✅ Complete - All field mappings updated, PermitDetails.jsx refactored

  - Refactored to use single-permit endpoint (api.getPermit(id))
  - All display fields now use extracted variables
  - **Completed**: Dec 13, 2025
