# Documentation Triage Analysis

**Date**: December 13, 2025  
**Purpose**: Classify all existing docs for governance restructure

---

## Classification Key

- 🟢 **KEEP** - Active, authoritative, move to proper folder
- 🟡 **CONSOLIDATE** - Valid but duplicated, merge and delete original
- 🔵 **ARCHIVE** - Historical only, freeze in /history/
- 🔴 **DELETE** - Noise, contradicts current state, remove

---

## Root Level Files

### 🟢 KEEP
- **PROJECT_ROADMAP.md** → Move to `roadmap/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`
- **IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md** → Move to `operations/IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md`

### 🔵 ARCHIVE
- **CURRENT_STATUS.md** → Move to `history/CURRENT_STATUS.md` (snapshot, not actively maintained)
- **MIGRATION_STATUS.md** → Move to `history/MIGRATION_STATUS.md` (completed migration, historical record)
- **SUPABASE_AUTH_STATUS.md** → Move to `history/SUPABASE_AUTH_STATUS.md` (implementation complete)
- **BUSINESS_ENTITY_AND_BILLING_MODEL.md** → Move to `business/` (active business rules)

---

## Existing Directories

### frontend/ ✅ KEEP AS-IS
- Recently refactored (Dec 13, 2025)
- Clean structure with summary, architecture, audit log, backlog
- No action needed

### guides/ 🟢 MOSTLY KEEP
- **API_DOCUMENTATION.md** ✅ KEEP
- **QUICKBOOKS_GUIDE.md** ✅ KEEP
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** ✅ KEEP
- **CHAT_TESTING_SOP.md** ✅ KEEP
- **WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md** ✅ KEEP
- **FIELD_MAPPING.md** ⚠️ CONSOLIDATE into `technical/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` (now database-driven)
- **PYDANTIC_VALIDATION_DEBUGGING.md** → Move to `audits/PYDANTIC_VALIDATION_DEBUGGING.md`
- **AUTH_*.md** files → Consolidate into `architecture/AUTHENTICATION_MODEL.md`

### setup/ ✅ KEEP AS-IS
- Active setup guides
- Well-organized
- No action needed

### deployment/ ⚠️ NEEDS TRIAGE
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** ✅ KEEP (update for Fly.io)
- **RENDER_*.md** files 🔵 ARCHIVE (migrated to Fly.io)

### technical/ ✅ MOSTLY KEEP
- **GOOGLE_SHEETS_*.md** 🔵 ARCHIVE (legacy, post-database migration)
- **PAYMENTS_FEATURE_DESIGN.md** ✅ KEEP
- **CONTEXT_ENHANCEMENT_PROGRESS.md** 🔵 ARCHIVE (completed work)
- **LOGGING_SECURITY.md** ✅ KEEP
- **BASELINE_METRICS.md** 🔵 ARCHIVE to `history/metrics/`

### session-logs/ 🔵 ALL ARCHIVE
- Move all to `history/session-logs/`
- Historical development records

### metrics/ 🔵 ALL ARCHIVE
- Move to `history/metrics/`
- Historical performance data

### archive/ ✅ ALREADY ARCHIVED
- Move to `history/archive/` (consolidate historical docs)

### deprecated/ 🔴 DELETE OR ARCHIVE
- Review contents
- Delete if truly obsolete
- Archive if needed for compliance

---

## Recommended Actions (In Order)

### Step 1: Move Active Docs to Canonical Locations
```
docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md → docs/roadmap/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md → docs/operations/IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md
docs/BUSINESS_ENTITY_AND_BILLING_MODEL.md → docs/business/BUSINESS_ENTITY_AND_BILLING_MODEL.md
docs/guides/PYDANTIC_VALIDATION_DEBUGGING.md → docs/audits/PYDANTIC_VALIDATION_DEBUGGING.md
```

### Step 2: Consolidate Auth Docs
Create `docs/architecture/AUTHENTICATION_MODEL.md` from:
- guides/AUTH_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- guides/AUTH_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
- guides/AUTH_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md

### Step 3: Move Frontend Docs
```
docs/frontend/FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md → docs/architecture/FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md
```
(Keep others in frontend/ for now - specialized subdomain)

### Step 4: Archive Historical Docs
```
docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md → docs/history/CURRENT_STATUS.md
docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md → docs/history/MIGRATION_STATUS.md
docs/SUPABASE_AUTH_STATUS.md → docs/history/SUPABASE_AUTH_STATUS.md
docs/technical/CONTEXT_ENHANCEMENT_PROGRESS.md → docs/history/CONTEXT_ENHANCEMENT_PROGRESS.md
docs/technical/BASELINE_METRICS.md → docs/history/BASELINE_METRICS.md
docs/deployment/RENDER_*.md → docs/history/deployment/RENDER_*.md
docs/technical/GOOGLE_SHEETS_*.md → docs/history/technical/GOOGLE_SHEETS_*.md
docs/session-logs/* → docs/history/session-logs/*
docs/metrics/* → docs/history/metrics/*
docs/archive/* → docs/history/archive/*
```

### Step 5: Review Deprecated/
- List contents
- Delete true noise
- Archive anything needed for compliance

### Step 6: Create Governance README
Replace `docs/README.md` with governance policy

### Step 7: Update Copilot Instructions
Add link to `docs/README.md` governance policy

## Files to Delete (After Review)

- `deprecated/*` - Review first, likely all noise
